import pictures from iphoto
---------------------------

in:
* iphoto directory
* doesn't pull any metadata or whatnot out of iphoto database (cause we don't use it).

out:
* directory where all pictures go into subdirectories per camera used
* duplicates are removed
* no further hierarchy on date/import data/metadata. iphoto lacks proper management so
  this assumes you'll do that outside of iphoto anyway.


iphoto folder hierarchy is not related to dates when the images were taken (i think they denote an import time);
also currently, often files will appear multiple times (presumably same image imported multiple times)
and also different images can have the same filename (two iphones with colliding image id's?)
since we can't really get them per-device out of iphoto (nor without the hierarchy), we parse the exif data
and rely on that.

import all pics from iphoto into a simple flat structure, without
pulling any metadata or whatnot out of iphoto (cause we don't use it).
why flat structure? cause there's no need to make a hierarchy,
and secondary, that works a bit easier with gqview/geeqie
iphoto folder hierarchy is not related to dates when the images were taken (i think they denote an import time);
also currently, often files will appear multiple times (presumably same image imported multiple times)
and also different images can have the same filename (two iphones with colliding image id's?)
since we can't really get them per-device out of iphoto (nor without the hierarchy), we parse the exif data
and rely on that.
